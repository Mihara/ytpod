Further in the plans:

* Find a tag library to put tags on downloaded files, including image.
* Learn to support more kinds of podcast, not just youtube, to produce static files with tags suitable for feeding to navidrome.
* config duplicating command line options, so that you put it all in one config and it runs as many times as needed.
* Support youtube playlists too if feasible.
