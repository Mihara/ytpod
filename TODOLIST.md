Further in the plans:

* Config duplicating command line options, so that you put it all in one
  config and it runs as many times as needed.
* Support youtube playlists too if feasible. This will most likely imply
  generating a feed from scratch and a lot of rewriting though.
* A generic podcast RSS feed downloader, rather than a youtube one, to double
  as a podcast fetcher.
* Other podcast-like objects, especially ones handled by youtube-dl, like
  soundcloud.
