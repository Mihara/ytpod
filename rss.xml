Perceivable Consequence! A very simple idea that can nevertheless be frustrating when it's not provided in games that call for it.  But also a very simple idea that should be ignored in games that benefit from ignoring it!</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://example.com/XfFteTrAvZw.mp4</guid><enclosure url="http://example.com/XfFteTrAvZw.mp4" length="0" type="video/mp4"/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2015 04:07:28 +0000</pubDate><itunes:image href="https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XfFteTrAvZw/hqdefault.jpg"/></item><item><title>Errant Signal - The Magic Circle (Spoilers)</title><link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7eCIkcMUdA</link><description>The Magic Circle has a lot of ideas about games, developers, fans, and how to ruin your eyes with artificial low-res graphics.

I may or may not do a video on Unreal soon - replaying the game's early bits has reminded me just how much that game got right in terms of a lighthanded touch to storytelling driven through architecture and a mix of scifi and fantasy that never felt forced the way Quake's did.  Still, the intro bits are what I've carried with me into adult hood, and I wanted to wax poetic about them a bit.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://example.com/qfVK_ZirSGo.mp4</guid><enclosure url="http://example.com/qfVK_ZirSGo.mp4" length="0" type="video/mp4"/><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2015 02:54:12 +0000</pubDate><itunes:image href="https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/qfVK_ZirSGo/hqdefault.jpg"/></item><item><title>Errant Signal - Sunset (Spoilers)</title><link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS_J214SXWU</link><description>Reddit thread for comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/errantsignal/comments/3bhgs2/errant_signal_sunset_spoilers_mark_ii/

Only If is a game about two obnoxious people yelling at each other.  It's a game about our inability to make sense of the world around us.  And it's a game that flirts with absurdist thought and low-brow sex comedy at the same time.

You know, I thought Aiden Pearce was an obnoxious character...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://example.com/f_K2kZfytbc.mp4</guid><enclosure url="http://example.com/f_K2kZfytbc.mp4" length="0" type="video/mp4"/><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2015 20:05:41 +0000</pubDate><itunes:image href="https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/f_K2kZfytbc/hqdefault.jpg"/></item><item><title>Errant Signal - Blendo Games (Spoilers)</title><link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa2fA0OCSNw</link><description>Reddit thread for comments: http://www.reddit.com/r/errantsignal/comments/349l0c/blendo_games/

I'm still a little antsy about treating Blendo's games like the work of "one" person.  They predominantly are to be sure, but it's not like Chung doesn't have collaborators.  Still, I think it's okay once you start seeing how often certain motifs, approaches, and ideas keep getting kicked around in Blendo's stuff.

If you wanted to play some of those early Citizen Abel or Barista games, they're still available on Blendo's website: http://blendogames.com/</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://example.com/xa2fA0OCSNw.mp4</guid><enclosure url="http://example.com/xa2fA0OCSNw.mp4" length="0" type="video/mp4"/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2015 11:46:54 +0000</pubDate><itunes:image href="https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/xa2fA0OCSNw/hqdefault.jpg"/></item><item><title>Errant Signal - Hotline Miami 2 (Spoilers)</title><link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KZXyEmULKM</link><description>Reddit thread for comments: http://www.reddit.com/r/errantsignal/comments/310rgv/hotline_miami_2_spoilers/

Hotline Miami 2 is a game that tries to explain what's going on, and that kinda sucks?</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://example.com/-KZXyEmULKM.mp4</guid><enclosure url="http://example.com/-KZXyEmULKM.mp4" length="0" type="video/mp4"/><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 05:22:51 +0000</pubDate><itunes:image href="https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/-KZXyEmULKM/hqdefault.jpg"/></item><item><title>Errant Signal - Life is Strange (Spoilers)</title><link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ5hEbz9MrI</link><description>Reddit thread for comments: http://www.reddit.com/r/errantsignal/comments/3003v7/errant_signal_life_is_strange/

So, originally this was gonna be an episode about Life is Strange.  Then my video card died and I was mostly left with leftover footage from Destiny.  So instead I cobbled together this response video (I guess?) to a lot of the commentary the last video got.  My technical problems should soon be resolved and we'll be back to our regularly scheduled program soon (with a return to looking at some smaller games!).  Mean time, here's me talking some more about Destiny, Farmville, Animal Crossing, and what it means for mechanics to have some not-so-great bits that get downplayed or reframed in the context of bigger systems.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://example.com/PmkDLZePGPE.mp4</guid><enclosure url="http://example.com/PmkDLZePGPE.mp4" length="0" type="video/mp4"/><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:25:02 +0000</pubDate><itunes:image href="https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/PmkDLZePGPE/hqdefault.jpg"/></item><item><title>Errant Signal - Destiny</title><link>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7VYd93oEbA</link><description>Reddit thread for comments: http://www.reddit.com/r/errantsignal/comments/2wud4v/destiny/

Destiny is a big empty nothing where you shoot dudes to fill bars ad infinitum.  By all accounts I should hate it.

But I kinda don't.  Let's look at why!</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://example.com/S7VYd93oEbA.mp4</guid><enclosure url="http://example.com/S7VYd93oEbA.mp4" length="0" type="video/mp4"/><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 05:32:00 +0000</pubDate><itunes:image href="https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/S7VYd93oEbA/hqdefault.jpg"/></item></channel></rss>
